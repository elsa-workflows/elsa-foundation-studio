/// Activates the default Studio shell before endpoint routing runs, so the endpoints a shell feature maps (theme
/// management, a module's bridge, …) are matched by routing — and therefore gated by the
/// authorization middleware — on the very first request as well as every later one.
///
/// <para>Without this, CShells activates a cold shell inside its own middleware, which runs <i>after</i> authorization,
/// and then re-matches the request against the freshly registered shell endpoints. Routing had matched the host's
/// <c>/_elsa/{**path}</c> fallback (which carries no policy), so authorization had already passed the request through:
/// the first request to a gated shell endpoint after a cold start would execute without its policy being evaluated.
/// Activating the shell first means routing sees the real endpoint and authorization enforces its policy.</para>
///
/// <para>Activation is best-effort: if it fails for any reason other than the caller aborting the request, the failure
/// is logged and the request continues, so a broken shell cannot turn static files or the SPA into 500s. CShells' own
/// middleware answers shell requests downstream as before.</para>
