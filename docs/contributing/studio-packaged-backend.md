# Use a packaged Workbench backend

This optional path runs Studio from source and connects it to a published Elsa Workbench image. The verified pair was Studio commit `7cb2f2c2381411694c470cdb9179402571bcf832` and Workbench source revision `592d6c0eb2a1ae45563ce5b234fb4e97af2867ed`, pinned to immutable image index `elsaworkflows/elsa-workbench@sha256:73ef26e41760eaa4618a37cfbd7285002408f634e4089201b3864cb1f6147904` (preview `4.0.0-preview.1115`). The tested platform was macOS arm64 using the Linux/arm64 image manifest. This result is specific to this source pair and tested platform.

Follow the prerequisites in [Make a visible Studio source edit](studio-source-quickstart.md), using a disposable clone so existing work stays untouched. Switch that clone to the verified commit before installing or editing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elsa-workflows/elsa-foundation-studio.git elsa-foundation-studio-contributor
cd elsa-foundation-studio-contributor
git switch -c contributor-reference 7cb2f2c2381411694c470cdb9179402571bcf832
node --version
pnpm --version
dotnet --version
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
dotnet build src/apps/Elsa.Studio.Web/Elsa.Studio.Web.csproj
```

You also need Docker running locally. Use the Development/SQLite configuration in Foundation’s [Docker Hub quickstart](https://github.com/elsa-workflows/elsa-foundation/blob/main/docs/docker-hub-quickstart.md). It documents the local Development seed `admin` / `Password123!`; do not use that seed outside a local Development host. Check Docker with `docker info` and inspect ports with `lsof -nP -iTCP:5089 -iTCP:5095 -sTCP:LISTEN`. If either port is occupied, stop here and wait until it is free; do not stop another session’s listener. This walkthrough uses the fixed Studio HTTP profile on port 5089.

The following creates a uniquely named container and fresh data/packages volumes for this run. The data volume stores the Data Protection SQLite file. Workbench workflow SQLite files remain in the container’s writable layer; the packages volume stores the Nuplane directory feed. Reusing a container or volumes is outside this disposable walkthrough. Run this block in a dedicated terminal and keep it open: later commands use its resource variables. Each resource carries this run’s ownership label, which cleanup verifies before removing it. The function stops on setup or readiness failure, attempts cleanup of resources created by this run, and returns to the prompt with a failure status so the terminal stays open. Continue only when it reports readiness.

Continue only after readiness succeeds. Keep the backend terminal open so its container and volume variables remain available for cleanup. In a second terminal, start Studio from the clone root. The two Studio settings must match the backend address and its local module-management key:

```bash
Studio__BackendBaseUrl=http://localhost:5095 \
Studio__BackendModuleManagementApiKey=elsa-docker-demo-key \
dotnet run --no-build --project src/apps/Elsa.Studio.Web/Elsa.Studio.Web.csproj --launch-profile http
```

Open `http://localhost:5089` and sign in with the Development seed. Keep Studio on this origin because the backend CORS and login return-origin settings name it. No Data Protection certificate is configured here, so this setup makes no encryption-at-rest claim.

Follow [Exercise a visible edit](studio-source-quickstart.md#exercise-a-visible-edit). For [Run a workflow in the browser](studio-source-quickstart.md#run-a-workflow-in-the-browser), use the name `Contributor packaged journey 585` instead of `Contributor source journey 583`, and set the Write Line text to `Hello from the packaged contributor journey 585` instead of the source walkthrough’s `583` text. Verify the run completes with no active incidents and confirm its expected stdout with `docker logs "$cid"` in the backend terminal.

When finished, stop your Studio host with Ctrl+C in its terminal. In the backend terminal, stop only the container you started and remove its two disposable volumes by their recorded names. The cleanup function checks each result and reports incomplete cleanup if any stop, remove, or volume removal fails:

```bash
cleanup_contributor_backend
```

## Verified result and recovery

The candidate image completed a browser journey: the published Flowchart run and its Write Line activity completed with no active incidents; stdout was `Hello from the packaged contributor journey 585`. Dashboard Attention still reported incomplete workflow runtime data. Studio’s Dashboard edit loop was also verified: changing the existing test expectation first produced one intended failure among 20 package tests; changing the heading then made all 20 pass. After rebuilding the module and Studio host and restarting Studio, the browser showed the edit. Restoring the two files returned their original hashes; package tests, typecheck, and module build passed, and after the host rebuild/restart the browser showed `Dashboard` again. This verifies rebuild/restart, not hot reload.

One older image, preview `4.0.0-preview.1085` (`sha-edffd0a`, source `edffd0a4ea18a17c4faa2c3f8ce073f48bc09af6`, digest `sha256:d7c7d1886dcce5277c3028ac82dceb8385f078c7a5da13f50e76aae751ac5656`), authenticated successfully but did not advertise `workflow-instances-health-filter`. Opening `/workflows/instances?incidentHealth=active` showed Studio’s unsupported-current-incident-health message and loaded no runs; clearing filters returned the empty unfiltered list. This was one missing capability, not evidence of general version incompatibility.

With the candidate image in a new container and new volumes, that capability was present and the same active-incident filter returned zero matching runs without the unsupported message. A newly created, published recovery workflow ran to completion with no active incidents and stdout `Hello from the recovered contributor journey 585`. This verifies a disposable fresh-data recovery only; it does not verify upgrading or migrating the older container’s data. The walkthrough and evidence are tracked in [Studio issue #585](https://github.com/elsa-workflows/elsa-foundation-studio/issues/585).

Verification reused an existing pnpm store (742 packages, no downloads), Corepack cache and possibly shared Docker base layers. The candidate image was confirmed absent before its pull; the older-image pull reused shared layers and downloaded additional layers. The candidate selected Linux/arm64 manifest `sha256:a14b221e28e055539da6280e716a1f37798c2f1bf74bedfa3e76e9cb159ee994`. Node 22.22.1, pnpm 11.9.0 and .NET SDK 10.0.300 were used. Vite builds emitted warnings; Dashboard Attention still reported incomplete workflow runtime data, and intentional host restarts produced console connection errors. The workflow and source-edit results do not imply every optional panel is healthy. An unfamiliar human contributor trial remains outstanding.
